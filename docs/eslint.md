## Code Quality Check

Rekit uses ESlint for code quality check. And uses [airbnb javascript guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) as the basic rules for all codes. There are slight changes defined in `.eslintrc` for different parts of a Rekit application.

Because it seems the rules suggested airbnb often change. There may be some eslint errors for a new created Rekit application. You need to either update the code or adding your own rules to clear those errors.
